# Dark-Hello-Kitty
Base Code is based on Hello Kitty by E O N S
This skin needs input in the wizard location as well. There still issues but it is functionally which I am working on it. 

Built from two other codes from:
<a href="https://github.com/ZerafinaCSS/Replace-the-AO3-Icons-2.0/tree/main">ZerafinaCSS for Icons changes to AO3</a>, <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/collections/Ao3skin/works/54000925">Cuephrase for Icons changes to stats</a> and <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/adhdfocusmusic/753939184137502720/ao3-site-skin-hello-kitty">Base from E_O_N_S hello kitty Ao3</a> 

Here are the inputs for Wizard.
